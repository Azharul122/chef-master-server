        "cookingMethod":" love my Kormas. Most of all I love Bangladeshi Kormas, which tend to be lightly spiced but heavily flavored. We do not put a lot of heavy cream like the Indian version but prefer onions and ghee to give the creaminess. I came across this recipe in the New York Times via Shama Mubdi",

Kosha is a semi-dry curry, where the chicken is cooked slowly with the spices over a long period of time. I consider this manual slow cooking. While labor intensive",
